Your friend knows niall as a friend and he said that you and niall gonna golf.

When he told you, you were in shock, first its niall horan! second you cant golf.

You disagreed a lot of times, you begged him, but nothing helped.

You gave up and let it happen.





you wake up '' this is going to be a mess''.

You make yourself ready, and eat some breakfast.

''have fun'' says your mother. '' thanks'' you says with a fake smile.

You arrive and sigh. You see niall walking to you.

He looks damm hot, '' oh gosh breath '' you think.

'' hi i, your friend didn't told me you were so beautiful''.

you blush.



you walk with him on the field, you look at the stick.

First you let him play. '' your turn'' he smiles.

You slowly walks to the spot, you look at the stick.

'' you know what, you can play all the time, i will watch''.

After all the games, the talks, the laughs.

'' common just one time'' he laughs.

you sigh and walk to the spot.

Niall walks to you and stands behind you.

you feel his arms on your body. 

'' good job'' he winks.

You give him a push '' you're such a flirt''.

you start to play with him.

He gets closer to you '' a what?''.

he laughs and you too.

'' a flirty boy'' you laugh.

'' you said what?!'' he screams and laughs.

suddenly he grabs you and kisses you.

'' never mind''
