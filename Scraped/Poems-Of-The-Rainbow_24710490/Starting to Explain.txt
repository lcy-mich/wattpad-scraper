Starting To Explain

I found these two poems,
The ones you’ve just read.
I found these poems,
From a time that seems so long ago,
When I didn’t know who was friend or foe.

I was so angry and messed up.
Nothing could fill the hole insi-i-i-de of me-e.
But slow-l-ley,
I-I’m Buil-ding my whole wor-ld again.

You don’t know what it’s like to be broke inside.
Everything spiralling, a web o-of lies.
That one shot, that one so quick shot, 
That stab of pain, of pain, 
That made every-thing go a-away-y. 

I thought I deserved it,
I thought nothing of it,
But now I see I was lashing out,
Because,
Because,
Oh, because,
Because because because because because,
I didn’t know who I re-ally was.

You don’t know what it’s like to be broke inside.
Everything spiralling, a web o-of lies.
That one shot, that one so quick shot, 
That stab of pain, of pain, 
That made every-thing go a-away-y. 

Can you imagine there being a big question mark?
One that will remain until you find the one?
The one for me is not a boyfriend,
As you might have presumed,
For there will be no wedding,
There can be never be a wedding,
For there is no-one to walk me down the ais-le.

You don’t know what it’s like to be broke inside.
Everything spiralling, a web o-of lies.
That one shot, that one so quick shot, 
That stab of pain, of pain, 
That made every-thing go a-away-y. 

And I’m ju-u-ust waiting for that day,
Where I can fin-ally look up to a face,
And say,
And say,
And say,
 ‘hi’
Because I’ve never been able to do that,
In my whole ent-ire li-i-fe.

But I know that dreaming won’t get me anywhere,
And I’ve just repaired my heart,
And I can’t let it break again.

You don’t know what it’s like to be broke inside.
Everything spiralling, a web o-of lies.
That one shot, that one so quick shot, 
That stab of pain, of pain, 
That made every-thing go a-away-y.
